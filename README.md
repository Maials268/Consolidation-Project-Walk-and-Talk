# Consolidation-Project-Walk-and-Talk
For the Consolidation project, I will be working with Maia and Christiana on a branding project for our podcast. Christiana is going to be doing the social media/logos for it, Maia is doing the website, and I will be editing our podcast (probably in iMovie). For our podcast, we plan to gear it towards college students on their walking commute to class (during non-COVID times) and we plan to record about three 10ish minute episodes today in class. I think we all have a good understanding of the tools we plan to use. My main role will be creating an intro for the podcast and editing it, which I think could get a little challenging as I don't have too much audio experience (other than the soundscape at the beginning of the semester) but I think it will be okay.
