<p>Podcast Episode #1 Transcript

0:27-0:37 [Cellphone Rings]
[0:38- 0:59]
Lydon: Hello everyone, and welcome to the first episode of Walk & Talk! This Podcast is by Pitt Students for
Pitt Students, completely unscripted. These podcasts will be on the shorter side, perfect for your commute to
class during non-COVID times. This first episode will be all about introducing ourselves, and we are going to
start off with my intro.
[1:00-1:12]
Lydon: So, my name is Lydon and I am a sophomore Computer Science major here at the University of
Pittsburgh and I am the Travel Director for Pitt Program Council here on campus as well as a member of WiCs.
[1:13-1:25]
Christianna: Hi, my name is Christianna Kelly. I’m a Digital Narrative and Interactive Design major with a
minor in Computer Science. I’m involved with the Delta Zeta Omicron chapter as well as the Women in
Computer Science club.
[1:29-1:32]
Lydon: Christianna, do you like being in a sorority?
[1:33-1:58 ]
Christianna: Yeah, I really enjoy it. I’m not gonna lie, I never imagined myself to be in one when I was coming
to a college, but since I was transferring here second semester of my freshman year, I figured it was the
perfect way to make friends. And honestly I can say I know all the girls have my back through everything and
beyond just the Sisterhood and the fun social events I’ve also love how our Sorority focuses on the Starky
Hearing Foundation which is our philanthropy because it reassures you that you’re in it for a great purpose and
that you’re helping people around the world.
[1:59-2:01]
Lydon:Wow, that’s really cool.
[2:01-2:02]
Christianna:Mhmm
[2:03-2:05] – Pause
[2:06]
Maia: Fun
[2:07-2:09] – Lydon, Chrisitanna, and Maia are laughing.
[2:10-2:50 ]
Lydon: And now, um, I guess also just to give a bit more background, (Christianna still laughing in the
background), sorry guys for this being completely unscripted, into what Pitt Program Councils is. Um, it is the
student-run event planning board here on campus, we have eight different sub-committees and we plan events
for our students, such as, during non-COVID times, trips to New York, trips to Cedar Point, trips to sports
games, um, as well as tons of other fun things for students to do on campus. And, before we get into Maia’s
intro, we are going to now take a quick break where we hear from this week’s sponsor:
[2:52-3:08 ]
Lydon: This week’s sponsor is Tina’s Café located on North Craig Street in North Oakland. With your Pitt
Student ID, you will be able to get 15% off your meal, this coupon will last until the end of the month so make
sure to check it out soon! And thank you so much to Tina’s Café for sponsoring our first episode!
sure to check it out soon! And thank you so much to Tina’s Café for sponsoring our first episode!
[3:12-3:14]
Lydon: And we’re back where we will end with Maia’s introduction!
[3:15- 3:32 ]
Maia: Oh, okay. Hi everyone, my name is Maia. I am a Public and Professional Writing major and I am also
majoring in History. I am a part of Phi Alpha Delta, FRESA, and RISE. And cool, yeah.
[3:33-3:36 ]
Lydon: Uh, what exactly is the Public and Professional Writing major?
[3:37-4:03 ]
Maia: Um, basically you learn how to do a lot of different types of writing so it’s in the English department
but it’s not really necessarily focused on what most people would think of like an English major. Like poetry or
just reading a lot of different novels, it’s more focused on how to write like business proposals, how to write
grant proposals, how to do like different types of research writing and critical writing. It’s very fun, very
interesting, I recommend it if you’re undecided! You should, you should do it.
[4:04} –
Christianna: That’s so cool.
[4:04-4:10 ]
Lydon: Definitely, do you have any idea what you want to do, um, when you graduate with that, or?
[4:11-4:28 ]
Maia: I do know that I, my full plan is to go to law school, so my main focus was to really take very writing
intensive courses like History and just Public and Professional Writing, so I’d be really prepped and ready for
that, cause it’s gon’ be intense.
[4:29- 4:42 ]
Christianna: I love that, yeah, my major Digital Narrative and Interactive Design is a joint major between the
Dietrich School of Arts and Sciences and the School of Computing and Information. So, it’s interesting that we
both take a lot of writing classes and English classes and I really enjoy my major as well.
[4:42-4:42]
Maia: Right, how did you find out about it?
[4:43 – 5:13]
Christianna: Um, my adviser actually recommended it to me because initially I was a Computer Science major
and was - I enjoyed my classes but it wasn’t, it wasn’t as enjoyable as I knew it could be, so I kind of wanted
to try something new and he offered that major to me and right after I heard about it, I knew that I would be
interested so I went with it. We’re all the guinea pig students for the major, because it’s brand new, but I’m
excited to see where it takes me, and I love all the classes that I’ve taken so far through it.
[5:13-5:14]
Lydon: Do you have any idea –
[5:13-5:14]
Maia: It sounds like –
[5:15- 5:16]
Lydon: Oh sorry!
[5:16-5:17]
Maia: No, you go.
[5:17- 5:22]
Lydon: Do you have any idea what you want to do after college with that major potentially or?
5:22-5:32 ]
Christianna: I’m not sure. The options are very open-ended, but I think doing something with graphic design
would be really cool in my opinion. What about you, do you have any idea what you want to do with Computer
Science?
[5:33- 6:01 ]
Lydon: Um, yeah, I’ve been floating around the idea of being like a technology consultant and kind of working
in that aspect. But I also was a software development intern this past summer, and I did enjoy that. So, I’m
definitely, I’m only a sophomore, so I’m still floating ideas around for sure. [Christianna – Cool] But, I’m
definitely enjoying my Computer Science classes at the moment. And then , kind of going back to Maia, I’m
curious what are- what is FRESA and RISE? I’ve never heard of those clubs.
[6:02-6:32]
Maia: Oh, okay. RISE is basically like, this thing, it’s for minority students. And it basically gives you a lot of
support as like minority students are very, just a small percentage at Pitt. So it gives you a lot of a support
and a support network to have like mentors and stuff like that and also to get certain money for books. And if
you’re interested in it, like, and they need a very supportive network and they are a minority student, it is
something I would definitely recommend joining cause it’s super helpful.
[6:35-6:38]
Christianna: That’s interesting. I might actually look into that because I’m half-Korean so
[6:39- 6:54]
Maia: If you’re interested, definitely, they give book money, scholarship money [Christianna – Oh, wow!], stuff
like that, mentors for any type of a, like major for anything like business, engineering, stuff like that.
[6:55-6:56]
Christianna: That sounds like a really cool opportunity!
[6:57- 7:24]
Lydon: Yeah, definitely! And I think, if any of the clubs we’ve mentioned in this episode sound interesting to
you, definitely check out our website as we will have About pages, where you can definitely, maybe get in
contact with us if you are interested in hearing more about any club. But other than that, we’re going to end
this week’s first episode! Thank you so much guys for listening to episode 1, and be sure to toon in next week
for another great episode about fun things to do in Pittsburgh!

Podcast Episode #2 Transcript
[0:00-0:26] Introduction Music (see Credits file for the music used in all intros/outros)
[0:27-0:41] -Cellphone Rings
[0:42-0:56]
Lydon: Hello everyone and welcome back to Walk & Talk! For this week’s episode, we will be talking all about
what fun things there are for Pitt students around the city. Obviously due to COVID, some of these activities
are not ideal at this time, but a lot of these are still an option in some capacity.
[0:57- 1:22]
Lydon: So to kick it off, I’m going to talk about my favorite thing to do which is take walks walks around
Schenley Park. Especially during our current pandemic, I find it really relaxing to get outside and get a little
fresh air when I’m locked up inside all day on Zoom classes. So, I like to walk around Schenley Park and walk
down to the lake they have, that I wasn’t aware of really prior to COVID, and then I was like woah this thing’s
huge!
[1:23-1:25]
Chrisitanna: I know exactly the spot that you are talking about. I love that trail.
[1:26-1:35]
Lydon: Yeah, it’s super pretty. So yeah, that’s definitely one of my favorite things to do around Pittsburgh.
What about you?
[1:36-1:55]
Christianna: Um, I personally have always been a huge like foodie, and I love my food. I just love trying all the
different restaurants, I feel like it’s literally impossible to try all the restaurants around here. So I like trying
different places in Shadyside, South Side, Downtown, just literally anywhere around, is just a great experience
to try new food and see, you never know what you are getting into honestly.
[1:56-1:58]
Maia: Right-
Lydon: Which one do you think is your favorite, sorry?
[1:59 – 2:30]
Christianna: I like the Yard a lot. I’m not sure if you guys are familiar with the Yard, but they make very fancy
grilled cheese sandwiches, they give you tomato soup on the side, and there is a lot of different sides you can
have. I know they have one Downtown, they have one in Market Square, and they have one in Shadyside on
Walnut Street. But yeah, it’s super good and I definitely recommend it if no one has tried it, but it was like on
the Food Network and that’s how I got exposed to it. [Maia: Oh cool!] Anytime, I have someone visit it me I
make sure I bring them to the Yard, it’s like my spot.
[2:31-2:39]
Lydon: Yeah, I knew there was one in Market Square, I didn’t know there was one in Shadyside. I think my
favorite food spot is this place called Smoke in Lawrenceville.
[2:41-2:44]
Christianna: Ok, I like Lawrenceville. I like their restaurants.
[2:45-2:50]
Lydon: They have smoked meat tacos and they also have mac’n’cheese that’s really good. [
[2:51-2:52]
Christianna: That sounds good!
[2:52-3:02]
Lydon: It’s so good. And, uh, COVID has ruined it because my Mom and I used to go like everytime, she
dropped me off to school. But you can’t eat inside right now.
[3:03-3:04]
Christianna: Mhmm. Have you been to Noodlehead?
[3:05-3:07]
Lydon: Yeah, I’ve been to Noodlehead.
[3:07-3:11]
Christianna: Yeah, but their not letting people eat inside with COVID so it’s like so much different than when
you’re there and eating it.
[3:12-3:13]
Lydon: Yeah.
[3:14-3:15]
Christianna: What about you Maia? What do you like to do around Pittsburgh?
[3:16-3:52]
Maia: Ooh, okay. Well I like to do a lot of thrifting cause that’s really fun.[Chrisitanna: Oh yes.] Everybody go
to Southside, yes, yes, make it happen. You’re not about to buy nothing. Also we have no malls, [Christianna:
Exactly] so you gotta Uber to the malls. So you gotta make it work. Exactly, you gotta bus pass, make it
happen, make it work. If you want to do actually like thrifting, thrifting than you go to like the Goodwill. If
you want to do semi-thrifting, but you’re still paying like full price, you go to like Buffalo Exchange.
[3:53-3:54]
Christianna: I’ve been to both those places, yes. So.
[3:55-4:04]
Maia: Right, right. You’re like, I’m familiar with the thrifting culture. It’s like actual thrifting versus you’re
just paying the same amount for the clothing.
[4:04-4:12]
Christianna: And there’s hidden gems. There’s always hidden gems. You never know what you are going to
find. [Maia: Exactly] I’ve gotten some of my favorite t-shirts and sweatshirts from thrifting.
[4:12-4:21]
Lydon: Yeah, and we will be back to talk more about thrifting. But quickly, we are going to take a quick break
to hear from this week’s sponsor.
[4:22-4:35]
Lydon: Hi everyone! This week’s sponsor is Lila’s jewelry located in Lawrenceville. This weekend only you will
be able to get 25% off your purchase of $30 dollars or more. So, make sure to go check out her shop in
Lawrenceville.
[4:36-4:50]
Lydon: And we’re back! Where we will end with a couple more minutes on thrifting and some of our other fun
favorite things to do! Also on the note of thrifting, Pitt has a thing called Thriftsburgh.
[4:51]
Maia: Oh, yeah, yeah.
[4:51-4:58]
Lydon: So, they will do that usually during Welcome Week during non-COVID times and it’s located in the
Ohara Student Center.
[4:58-4:59]
Maia: It’s a good time.
[5:00-5:10]
Lydon: I just picked up a $1 dollar pair of jeans, one time, I didn’t try them on. I was like if it’s one dollar, if
they don’t fit what’s my loss?
[5;10]
Christianna: Treat yourself.
[5:10-5:12]
Lydon: And they fit and I was like, yes!
[5:13]
Christianna: That’s literally the best thing ever.
[5:14-5:30]
Maia: I feel that. Yes. Thriftsburgh during Welcome Week is very interesting, Cause I’m like, these are really
good clothes for like a dollar, and I think it’s cause all the richy rich students be like donating their really nice
stuff, and then they resell it for like 10 dollars. And I’m like, a bargain.
[5:31-5:36]
Lydon: Yeah, like expensive there is like the 5 dollar microwave.
[5:36-5:37]
Maia: Right, right! That’s when you’re like-
[5:38-5:43]
Christianna: Yeah, it’s like garage sale vibes almost but like you can get some of the best stuff.
[5:44-5:49]
Maia: For sure, for sure. I got like 5 shirts for like 5 dollars.
[5:50]
Christianna: Yeah.
[5:51- 6:07]
Maia: Ah, some good shirts. I’m not gonna lie, Thriftsburgh they got it going on. They got it going on.
Especially during Welcome Week when their prices are like ooh, there good. You can get a pair of shoes for
like 50 cents. I’m like, I like it, I like it.
[6:08]
Lydon: Yeah.
[6:09-6:17]
Christianna: I feel like the theme of this whole podcast has been about pre-Corona times, which is sad. Like
how the world used to be before corona.
[6:18-6:20]
Maia: Right, like before you would have had Welcome Week.
[6:21-6:26]
Lydon: Positive note, I mean Schenley Park you can do that, during right now. Like I said that’s what I’ve been
doing.
[6:26-6:40]
Christianna: If anything, I’ve been embracing like nature and the outdoors more than ever before because of
corona. Which is like amazing, because that peacefulness and I don’t know the crisp fall air with the leaves. It
just hits different.
[6:4-6:52]
Maia: True. I’ve gone on more nature hikes than ever in my life and I- by that I mean like a total of three. But
like – that’s a lot. For me personally, that’s a lot.
[6:52-7:04]
Lydon: Yeah, and then also some museums I know and like Phipps Conservatory have limited occupancy so you
can sign up and try and do that. Pitt students get in for free, love free things!
[7:05-15]
Maia: Ooh, movies when that was a thing. Oh god, what if the movie theater doesn’t come back. I don’t want
to think about that, Southside Works movie theater though.
[7:16-7:17]
Christianna: I’m resminicing too hard.
[7:18-7:30]
Maia: Good times. I hope, I hope their still here. Movie theaters are taking it really rough during this time, so
go check that out, if their still there when you come back.
[7:30]
Christianna: Mhmm
[7:31-7:32]
Maia: Go look it up. Go look at it.
[7:33-7:34]
Christianna: We have endless recommendations for Pittsburgh.
[7:35-7:46]
Maia: Truly, truly. Except I don’t know, Pittsburgh sometimes be like, why do you have to Uber to go to really
cool things? Like one time I went rollerblading but we had to Uber there, and I was like if y’all had these
things closer.
[7:47-7:53]
Christianna: Yeah, even like Mount Washington, at the overlook, if you don’t have a car, you will have to get
some sort of transportation.
[7:54-8:01]
Maia: Right, so sometimes I’m like mmmm, but there are good things. Ok, we’re trying to up Pittsburgh!
[8:01-8:22]
Lydon: Yeah, and with that we’re going to end this week’s episode. But if you ever want to reach out to us for
more recommendations, feel free to check out our website. But otherwise, thanks for listening guys and be

Podcast Episode #3 Transcript
0:00-0:26 [Introduction Music]
0:27-0:37 [Cellphone Rings]
[0:38- 1:20]
Lydon: Hello everyone, and welcome back to the third episode of Walk & Talk! In this week’s
episode, we will be talking about our best pieces of college advice. So to start off, my best piece
of advice is join clubs! When you first come to campus, it’s easy to meet people on your floor
and what not. But definitely when you join clubs that’s when you meet people with definitely
similar interests to yours. For instace, I’m in the women in computer science club so a lot of
those people in that club are computer science majors who I can then turn to when I am
struggling on my computer science assignments all the time. And definitely we all share a
common interests there. Um, what about you guys? Do you find that-
[1:21-1:40]
Christianna: Yeah, I completely agree with you. I feel like every club that I have joined I have
found people with the same interests with me obviously and I’ve had very good success with
that and it’s definitely a good way to like come out of your bubble and meet people. Especially
coming to a huge campus, it can be hard at times but that’s definitely the best way to meet
people.
[1:40-2:05]
Maia: Definitely a good way to like network and I don’t know just, finding yourself a nice, little
supportive network of people who are just interested either in the same things as you or just
have a similar identity or background is always good when you’re looking for clubs. Just finding
a way to connect, cause the campus is pretty big and there’s a lot of different people. You just
kind of want to find your place, find your little home.
[2:06-2:19]
Christianna: I’ve definitely found some of my best friends here at Pitt through clubs. And as a
junior, I’m sad that I’m almost graduating in a year because I don’t want to leave those people
and leave those clubs but I know that those people that I met will always be in my life and there
for me.
[2:20-2:21]
Lydon: Yeah, definitely.
[2:25-2:28]
Christianna: Maia, what about you do you have any advice?
[2:28-2:29]
Maia: About what? Oh, sorry.
[2:30-2:32]
Christianna: Just about student life, and life at Pitt, at a big campus.
[2:33-3:32]
Maia: Life at Pitt. Me just like, what are we talking about again? Ok. Advice, let’s do this. Oooh,
let’s talk about dorms and stuff, that’s interesting. Ok so freshman year, people are nasty,
people are really nasty. Their very gross, you might walk in on a girl crying and throwing up in
the toilet with her friend being like ‘No he’s wrong, you are really pretty’. And you’re going to
be confused, but you are just going to brush your teeth anyway and not ask about it. You’re not
going to ask about it, because this girl’s just crying, you know she’s drunk crying, we’re all
confused. But your gonna brush your teeth, take a shower, and leave it at that, you’re not going
to ask. She’s fine, she’s got someone taking care of her. If you see green beans in the shower,
you let it go. And you go to the next shower, and you don’t question it, because that is not your
problem. That is not your problem.
[3:33-3:46]
Christianna: I think everyone has horror stories of living with living on-campus. I personally lived
on campus my freshman and sophomore year, and I have lots of stories like that. Every day
there is never a dull moment, you never know what to expect so just be prepared for
everything.
[3:46-3:55]
Maia: Be prepared, Towers living is something else people. It is something else. Living in a giant
battery is a lifestyle.
[3:55-3:56]
Lydon: Yeah, I lived in, I lived in Sutherland so-.
[3:57-4:03]
Maia: Ok, ok miss prissy over here in Sutherland, alright.
[4:05-4:08]
Lydon: I wasn’t in Nordenberg like I wasn’t at the top of-
[4:08-4:10]
Maia: Oh, wow. That’s like, I would be bad if you were in Nordenberg
[4:10-4:14]
Christianna: I was in a single in Holland Hall. So..
[4:15-4:17]
Maia: Oooh, no AC, that’s rough.
[4:18-4:21]
Christianna: Yeah, it was interesting to say the least.
[4:21-4:25]
Lydon: I’m in Brackenridge this year, also with no AC. I’m a little warm right now, not gonna lie,
but it’s okay.
[4:26-4:30]
Christianna: Yeah, I was in McCormick last year as a sophomore which is right next to
Brackenridge in the Quad.
[4:31-4:41]
Lydon: Yeah, and before we get into our last piece of advice we are now going to take a quick
break where we can hear from this week’s sponsor.
[4:42-4:55]
Lydon: This week’s episode is being sponsored by Emma’s Stationary where you can get 30
percent off planners with your Pitt Student ID till the end of the month. With one of these
planners, you will definitely be able to beat procrastination like we talk about in this week’s
episode.
[4:56-5:00]
Lydon: And we’re back! Where we will end with Christianna’s piece of advice.
[5:01--5:45]
Christianna: My piece of advice is more for schoolwork and workload. I would say that
procrastination, we all do it, but I recommend that you try and get your work done ahead of
time. My roommate is actually very good at working ahead and getting assignments done
before they need to be done. And she seems to have a lot of free time at the end of her days
and at the end of her weeks so a quote that I like to refer to is from Bill Waterson, it says ‘A day
can slip by where you are deliberately what you’re supposed to do’. And I think all three of us
can agree that we procrastinate, we have procrastinated in college. So, we’re not going to sit
here and act like it never happens and that we don’t do it, but my advice take it from someone
who does a lot of procrastinating is to not procrastinate.
[5:46-6:01]
Lydon: Yeah, definitely. I think, sometimes, the way that I procrastinate is to do the less
important work to avoid the more important work. Like I will do the mini little writing
assignment due in three weeks to avoid the big project due in a week.
[6:02-6:05]
Maia: Don’t play yourself, don’t to it people.
[6:06-6:18]
Christianna: Exactly, and I know that you might feel very motivated when the due date is
coming up in an hour. And you have to submit it in an hour, and that’s when you might get the
most motivation, but don’t do that.
[6:18]
Maia: It’s not a good idea.
[6:19-6:20]
Christianna: It will cause a lot of unnecessary stress for you.
[6:20-6:45]
Maia: It really will. Do not do other things, as we were kind of saying before, don’t do other
things in the place of the things that you need to be doing. Like you know, cleaning your
bathroom, cleaning your room, don’t do it and tell yourself that you’re being productive. Like
no, you’re not. You’re not doing it, we all know that this is a game that you are playing with
yourself and it is not a good idea. Do not recommend. Get your work done.
[6:46-6:58]
Christianna: Yeah, maybe just hide your phone. And tell your roommate to take your phone or
something so that you’re not distracted. Basically just don’t do everything that you shouldn’t be
doing, to avoid what you should be doing.
[6:59-7:10]
Maia: Right, do not distract yourself from being distracted. I’ve done that. Don’t open up
multiple tabs, googling things based on the thing that you were already googling that was not
your work. Just don’t do it.
[7:11]
Christianna: Take it from us.
[7:11-7:42]
Lydon: Yeah, definitely. And I think some tips to avoid procrastination is like to try and set
specific times for yourself to maybe get work done. Like maybe Tuesday’s from 4-6 in between
your two classes like maybe that’s a good time for you to work. Or maybe, you know you decide
your a morning person so you’re going to go to Hillman from 8 am to noon on Saturday because
that’s when no one else is there and you work best. I think it’s definitely about finding the time
that works best for you.
[7:42-7:58]
Maia: Right, and maybe you lie to yourself and you’re not a morning person, and you’re a night
owl. Just go with it, go with the flow if you’re a night owl, stand in your night owlness and stay
up as late as you need to, be up late, and get your work done.
[7:59-8:01]
Christianna: Exactly, do whatever works for you. Cause everyone’s different.
[8:02-8:16]
Lydon: Because I know personally, I’m a morning person, after like 1 am at the max, it is not
productive. I might be able to stay awake, but, I will not process anything so…
[8:17-8:23]
Christianna: Yeah, for me I can’t be productive until after 10 pm usually. So we’re very different
in that way.
[8:24-8:32]
Maia: Exactly, exactly. You’ve got yourself a night owl, you got yourself a morning bird.
Morning…what is it? Morning bird?
[8:33]
Lydon: I think it’s a morning person.
[8:33-8:37]
Maia: It’s something! No, there’s definitely a name for it.
[8:36-8:37]
Lydon: Night owl….early bird
[8:38-8:41]
Maia: Early bird! Yeah, maybe you’re one of those.
[8:42-8:43]
Lydon: Oh, I’m definitely one of those.
[8:43-8:44]
Maia: I’m a still say morning bird.
[8:45-8:46]
Lydon: Where would you say you fall? Are you a night owl?
[8:47-8:59]
Maia: I’m a night owl definitely. Or I’m weird, because sometimes I’m like good in the
afternoon, but then sometimes I’m sleepy. I don’t know, I can’t commit to any of these things.
[9:00-9:09]
Christianna: I could be a morning person some days if I needed to [Maia: Right], but it seems to
be that the majority of the time I tend to do work very late at night.
[9:10]
Maia: For sure.
[9:11-9;13]
Lydon: Have you guys ever pulled all nighters?
[9:14]
Christianna: Yes.
[9:15-9:25]
Maia: I have from being really stressed out, it wasn’t even like I was doing work, I was just really
stressed and I couldn’t go to sleep. But, yeah.
[9:26-9:33]
Christianna: I think I’ve done one every semester. It’s not like a - It’s usually around the finals
week too.
[9:34-9:39]
Lydon: So it’s coming? [Christianna: Yeah] Yeah, I have never pulled an all-nighter.
[9:39-9:41]
Maia: Oh, geez. How many projects do you guys have? I have just ahh…
[9:41-9:45]
Lydon: I have a lot of projects at the moment. But…
[9:46-9:49]
Maia: Same, same! I’m gonna cry, I feel like crying.
[9:50-9:56]
Christianna: It’s because our majors are very assignment and project-oriented rather than exam
oriented.
[9:57-10:01]
Lydon: Agreed. And with that we are going to end Walk & Talk’s third episode, be sure to toon
in next week!
[10:02]
Lydon: And don’t procrastinate!
[10:02-10:06]
Christianna: Yes, don’t procrastinate! And meet new friends!
[10:07]
Maia: Meet people!
